********* Queues *********

=> First item in is the first item out

How they are used?
    - Background tasks
    - Uploading resources
    - Printing / Task processing

Array Implementation
 => Can use .push() and .shift() or .unshift() and .pop()  ** shift/unshift will cause the array to be re-idexed = bad time complextiy **


If concerned about performance it is best to implement your own queue class!

Linked List Implementation
=> create node and queue classes
