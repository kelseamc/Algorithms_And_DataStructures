******* What are Trees ********
=> A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
    - nodes can store any type of data but usually strings or numbers

    Lists = linear
    Trees = nonlinear (one node can point to multiple nodes)

****** Tree Rules ******
    1. A node can only point to a child. It cannot point to one of its siblings and a child cannot point to its parent
    2. Can only have one root node that is the start of the tree


******* Terminology ********
    - Root = the top node of the tree
    - Child = a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
    - Parent = the converse notion of a child
    - Siblings = a group of nodes with the same parent
    - Leaf = a node with no children
    - Edge = the connection between two nodes


******* Uses of Trees ********
    > HTML DOM
    > Network Routing
    > Abstract Syntax Tree
    > Atificial Intelligence
    > Folders in operating systems
    > Computer file systems
    > JSON


******* Binary Search Trees ********
    > each node at most can have 2 children
    > every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
    > every node to the right of the parent node is alway greater than the parent
